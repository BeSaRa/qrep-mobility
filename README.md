**Developer Documentation for Mobile Real Estate Qatar**

This comprehensive developer documentation is intended for software developers, engineers, and contributors who wish to understand and utilize Real estate. Whether you are a newcomer seeking to grasp the fundamental concepts or an experienced developer looking for in-depth insights into the project, this documentation will serve as a guide to navigate through the various aspects of real estate mobility.

**Introduction and Overview**

Real estate is a robust platform designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for real estate interests. It functions as a centralized hub, offering valuable data regarding rental properties, sales listings, mortgage information, and a directory of real estate brokers. This platform aims to streamline and simplify the process of accessing essential real estate information while providing convenient methods for users to engage with and contact various brokers.

**Purpose and Goals**

The primary objective of Real estate is to aggregate and present crucial information related to the real estate market, catering to individuals seeking rental accommodations, properties for sale, or mortgage options. Through this platform, users can effortlessly access a wide array of data while facilitating direct communication channels with real estate brokers for inquiries or transactions.

**Scope of Documentation**

This developer documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and contributors aiming to understand the underlying structure, functionalities, and integration points within Real estate. It aims to elucidate the architecture, usage, configuration, and best practices necessary for effective utilization and potential contributions to the platform's growth and enhancement.

**Key Features:**

**Property Sales Data**

Real estate specializes in providing detailed information about sold properties, highlighting data on the top 10 areas and their corresponding sale prices, aiding users in analyzing prevalent real estate market trends.

**Property Rentals**

Similarly structured to the sales data, this segment furnishes an extensive compilation of rental property information. Users can explore details about available rental properties, encompassing rental rates, property attributes, lease terms, and contact information for property managers or landlords.

**Mortgage Information**

It is like sell and rent , but without top 10 section

**Real Estate Broker Directory**

Real estate features a meticulously curated directory showcasing licensed real estate brokers. Each profile includes detailed information about the broker's Data and contact details ,facilitating seamless connections between users and reputable professionals for real estate transactions and guidance

**Code Structure Overview:**

in lib folder you can view the core code to the application

it is 4 layers
**App Layer:** This layer typically contains the code responsible for initializing the app, routing between different screens, managing app-wide state (if applicable), and generally orchestrating the flow of the application.

**Data Layer:** The data layer deals with data access and management. It includes interactions with data sources such as databases, API services, local storage, etc. This layer often includes repository classes that abstract data retrieval and storage details from the rest of the application.

**Domain Layer:** The domain layer encapsulates the core business logic and rules of the application. It defines entities, use cases, and interactors that represent the essential functionalities of your app without being dependent on any specific implementation details.

**Presentation Layer** : This layer is responsible for UI components and the interaction between the user and the application. It includes Views (UI components/widgets), ViewModels (if using MVVM), and presentation logic required to render and manage the UI.

**How They Interact:**

- App Layer & Presentation Layer: The App layer initializes the app and manages routing between different screens. It interacts with the Presentation layer to display UI elements and manage user interactions.

- Data Layer & Domain Layer: The Data layer provides data to the Domain layer through repositories or data sources. The Domain layer contains the business logic that works on this data.

- Presentation Layer & Domain Layer: The Presentation layer interacts with the Domain layer to access business logic, perform use cases, and display data received from the Domain layer.

- Key Advantages:Separation of Concerns: Each layer focuses on specific responsibilities, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

- Scalability: The separation allows for easier scaling or modification of specific functionalities without affecting other parts of the application.

- Code Reusability: Proper separation facilitates reusing code across different layers or modules.

**Code Structure Overview:**

I will explain one flow of work.

Let's work to get rent transactions.

1. add the endpoint (endpoint file is in the network folder in data folder )
2. add the request model to models files in domain folder (you should view freezed library for reference on the work here )
3. add the request in app\_api file like :
   @POST(EndPoints._rentSummary_)
   Future\<HttpResponse\<RentListSummary\>\> rentSummary(
   @Body() RequestMeanValue requestMeanValue);
4. now generate the data using in the terminal :
   flutter pub get && flutter pub run build\_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
5. in repository file in the domain layer we will add the method
   Future\<Result\<RentListSummary, FailureModel\>\> getRentSummary(

RequestMeanValue requestMeanValue);

1. then we will add the implementation in repository\_implementater file in the data layer
   @override
   Future\<Result\<RentListSummary, FailureModel\>\> getRentSummary(
   RequestMeanValue requestMeanValue) async {
   if (await networkInfo.isConnected) {
   try {
   final response = await appServiceClient.rentSummary(requestMeanValue);
   if (response.response.statusCode == 200) {
   return Success(response.data);
   } else {
   return Error(FailureModel.fromJson(response.response.data));
   }
   } on DioException catch (e) {
   return Error(FailureModel.fromJson(e.response?.data ??defaultError));
   } catch (e) {
   return Error(FailureModel(message: AppStrings().defaultError)); }
   } else {
   return Error(FailureModel(message: AppStrings().noInternetError)); }
   }
2. create the use case in domain folder, we use multiple result library to make it :
   class RentSummeryUseCase
   implements BaseUseCase\<RequestMeanValue, RentListSummary\> {
   late final Repository repository;

RentSummeryUseCase(this.repository);

@override
Future\<Result\<RentListSummary, FailureModel\>\> execute(
RequestMeanValue input) async {
return await repository.getRentSummary(input);
}
}
3. we will make the bloc in the presentation using freezed to create
4. add the bloc and use case to dependency injection file in app folder
5. call the method of declaring the dependency injection before using it in the screen

that's it this how how to implement new api
